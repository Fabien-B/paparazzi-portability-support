ivy-python (2.3~pre-2-0~ppa1) precise; urgency=low

  * update to 2.3-pre-2:
    v2.3-pre-2
    ----------

    * The serial number for PING/PONG messages is not exposed anymore in the API.
      In fact, it is also not used anymore in the protocol.

    * Removed the ability to mimic ivy-c behaviour.

    v2.3-pre-1
    ----------

    * ping/pong: fully implemented

    * Fixed: any error occurring when an agent tried to establish the
      connection to a new client on the bus, triggered an AttributeError
      exception within UDP_init_and_listen(): as a result, that agent was
      not detecting any new clients on the bus afterwards.  Thanks to
      Antoine Drouin for noticing it and proposing the patch.

    * ivy-python agents now properly reply to ping requests, thanks to
      Fabien André.  They cannot ping other agents yet.

    * std_api.IvyMainLoop(): now honors SIGINT, thanks to Fabien André

    * Fixed: when a message was sent on the bus matching two or more
      subscriptions of an agent, only one message was actually sent to
      this agent, meaning that only one of the corresponding callbacks was
      called.  This is no longer the case, and ivy-python now behaves as
      expected: all callbacks bound to subscriptions that a message posted
      on the bus matches are now triggered, no matter how many such
      subscriptions one agent has.

      All credits go to Felix Ruess, member of the paparazzi UAV project's
      team, who reported the bug and submitted the fix. Many thanks, Felix!

    * Fixed: an exception was raised when trying to send a message
      corresponding to a subscription in which an optional group is not
      participating to the match (example: subscription regexp='MSG(.*)?',
      msg='MSG'). Thanks to github user «alonsoac» for reporting the bug
      and to Felix Ruess for telling me!

    * IvyServer.send_direct_message(): new parameter 'stop_on_first' added

    * Bohdan Mushkevych has done a lot of work on the source code to clean
      it up, to correct misspellings, and to make it more "Pythonic"
      (especially by following pep8 recommendations).
      Great job, thanks a lot Dan!
