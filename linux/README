This directory holds files used to create toolchains and packages used in the Paparazzi project

How to build
-------------
cd arm-none-eabi-gcc-linaro
sudo dpkg -P paparazzi-arm-multilib
sudo mkdir -p /opt/paparazzi
sudo chown <username>:<username> /opt/paparazzi
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -b -uc

For testing purposes, you can make a .deb file without rebuilding the sources like this
fakeroot debian/rules binary

once the package is build remove /opt/paparazzi/arm-multilib
and the package will install there in place
